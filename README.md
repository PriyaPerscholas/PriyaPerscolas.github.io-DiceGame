Welcome to Dice Game.

Dice game is played between two players.Each person takes turn and the person scorces higher is the winner of the game.I used HTML,CSS,JavaScript to create this game.This game is played in DOM with some CSS effect to bring real touch to the game.

This game is played with two dice for each player.I used Math.random() function to generate the random numbers for the dice. The random numbers generated for two dice is added to give the result of highest number.Then strict camparsion is done between two players for three condition to determine the result of the game. If player1 scorce is equal to player2 ,then  game is DRAW!!.If player1 scorce is greater than player2, then player1 is Winner!!.If player2 scorce is greater than palyer1 ,player2 is winner!!. I used prompt to change the name of the players.

Future Scope:
Planning to continue the game for 5 times, the scorce board is to setup in the DOM and capture the results for each turn. Then sum up the results of each turn to figure out ,how is the winner at the end of 5 turns.Have a plan for restart option,when players wants to start from  beginning.

Technologies used:HTML,CSS,JavaScript.
