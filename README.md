Welcome to Dice Game.

Dice game is played between two players.Each person takes turn and the person scorces higher is the winner of the game.I used HTML,CSS,JavaScript to create this game.This game is played in DOM with some CSS effect to bring real touch to the game.

This is a simple dice game where two players have the chance to roll the dice to try and achieve a score of 100. Each player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold".

How to Play !

The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he/she whishes. Each result gets added to his/her Total score.
BUT, if the player rolls a 1, then all his/her Total score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his/her Total score gets added to his/her Final score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
The first player to reach 100 points on Final score wins the game.
Players can also set a winning score at any point of the game.
Default winning score is 100.
